# A-Highly-Techincal-Documentation-Page-Project
An HTML/CSS responsive Technical Documentation Page Project

This project was a great learning experience because I learned how to set aside navigation bar that was fixed to the side of the screen with a resolution size of 815px or greater, but when less than that I had to use @media to account for smaller laptops and cellphones. Nevertheless, positioning the elements for smaller screen sizes was also a challenge, but display block and positioning definitely made the difference.
